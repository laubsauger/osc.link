# osc.link

OSC.LINK is a control interface for realtime interaction between a mobile or desktop browser, and the OSC protocol. It was designed for the rapid-prototyping of multi-user media installations, and simple extensible deployment for mobile phone interaction without the cumbersome steps of joining a network, downloading an app, or signing up for an account.

By snapping a QR code or following a simple URL, user mobile devices are turned into input controllers that can send active and passive interaction data to a local client, and then fed to any platform that can recieve OSC, such as game engines, DAWs or media servers
